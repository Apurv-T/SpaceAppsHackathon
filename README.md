Team: Radioactive Maps
Challenge Solved: The radioactive data from CSA is not present in a user-friendly format. Make a user friendly mobile app or website to show the data as well as have the business side of the solution made as well.

Solution: We cleaned the data and analysed the data using Grafana, which is licensed allowing commercial uses. Then we took the clean data to make user friendly maps on the web application. The type of maps for radioactivity in Canada were not at all user friendly and because of less data available, there were no user-friendly maps and heat maps that can be easily accessed by general public.

The Team: The team consisted of 5 people, where my part was purely consisting of:
•	Business (Customer Validation, Cost and Revenue Structure, Marketing methods and per Customer Acquisition cost)
•	Data Cleaning and Data Integration.

The main Tools Used:

1. Grafana, Python and R for Back End.
2. Node.js, Angular.js, Booststrap for front end.

The Result:
    3rd Position for the CSA Challenge in Nova Scotia.
